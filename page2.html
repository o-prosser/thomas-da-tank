	<h1>Dark information</h1>
<p>The time is 1918, the war has just ended and the steam engine production has increased expedentionally. New experimental engines were being made all over the country.</p>
	 <td  colspan="1" ><img height="93" src="Images/old_drawing_of_train.jfif"></td>
	<p>One of these new experimental engines was going to change the game within the goods trains game, it was going to be stronger than any engine that came before but before the plans were finished they were stolen.</p>
<td  colspan="1" ><img height="93" src="Images/Train_plans.jfif"></td>
	<p>The unfinished plans were then used to create an engine that the people that stole the plans thought would give them a new solution to all their problems. Once this ne train was created and painted the builders noticed a few issues with the train: not a good size fire box that didn't burn the coal they used efficiently. The green paint was beautiful on the large train, all the issues about the train ,however, were completely forgotten as soon as the owner of the yard arrived. He was drawn to the engine, when he arrived he noticed the engine did not have a name so he called it Henry.</p>
